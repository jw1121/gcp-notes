  # GCP Security  
  
  ## GCP IAM Service Account
  > Full access control and visibility to centrolly manage cloud resources.
  
  - Manage authorization only.
  - SA is both `resource` and `identity`, where user can be granted access to SA and grant roles to a SA.
  - use display name (email) to help manage SA.
  - keys are used for service-to-service call.
  - Can create max 10 keys per SA and 100 SA per project
  - two types of keys:
    - GCP managed keys
      - Canâ€™t be downloaded and auto rotated before 2 weeks
    - User managed keys
      - can download and expires after 10 yrs
  
  ### Roles
  #### Role types:
  - Primitive roles
    - viewer: read-only permission
    - editor: viwer + permission to modify 
    - owner: editor + manage role and permission
  - Predefined roles
    - additional role that give granular access to specific resource.
  - Custom roles
    - user can create reate custiomzed IAM roles.
    - `iam.roles.create` permission required to create custome role
     
  ### Service Accounts
  - special kind of account that belong to an application or a VM instance.
  - Used for:
    - Running workload on VM
    - Running workload on on-prem or data center that calls Google APIs
    - Running workload not tied to the lifecycle of a human user.
  - SA do not have password and cannot log in via broswers or cookies
  - SA associated with RSA key for authentication
  - SA are not memebr of Gsuite
  - User can be given permission to impersonate SA.
  - User can create short-lived credentials to assume the identity of SA.
  
  ### Resource hierarchy
    - Organization, Folder, Project, Resource
    - IAM policies are hierachical and progate down the structure.
  
  ### Best practice
  - Use hierachy to group resources that share same trust boundary and use inheritance. (eg. group instead of user(s), folder instead of projects)
  - Use the security principle of least privilege when granting IAM roles.
  - Grant role to group instead of a user.
  - policy set on child resource cannot restrict access granted on it parent
  - Use label to annotate, group, and filter resources
  
  ## KMS
  - 3 type of encryption keys: GMEK, CMEK (Customer Managed Encryption Key), CSEK (Customer Supplyed Encryption Key) 
  - CMEK works with:BigQuery, Cloud Build, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Storage, Compute Engine
  - In Cloud Storage CMEK and CSEK uses the key when encrypting:
    - The object's data.
    - The object's CRC32C checksum.
    - The object's MD5 hash.
  - metadata can be read and updated without the encryption key.
  
  ## Cloud Identity 
  > `Identity groups` let you map to external identity from outside and designate spacial label external.
  
  ## VPC service control
  > Mitigate the risk of data exfiltration from services like Cloud Storage and BigQuery.
  
  #### Benefits
  - Prevent access from unauthorized networks using stolen credentials
  - Prevent data transfer by malicious insider or comprised code
  - Prevent exposure of private data caused by misconfigured IAM.
  - Its not design to enforce control on metadata acccess/movement.
  
  ## Cloud DLP
  > Help you better understand and manage sensitive data to classify and redact.
  
  ## Cloud Armor
  > Defense at scale against infrastructure and application DDOS and other web attacks.
    
  - Made up of rules that allow or prohibit traffic to your Load Balaancer
  - Can preview thr effects of the rules in a security policy in stackdriver log without enforcing the actions in the rules. 
  - rules are evaluated based on  priority set, from lowest to highest or 0 to 2147483647.
  - 3 use cases:
      - Limit access to the GCP HTTP(S) Load Balancer with allow lists
      - Block traffic at the edge with deny lists
      - Allow traffic to the HTTP Load Balancer only from allowed 3rd party/authorized users.
  - Cloud Armor can be used in followin scenarios:
      - Allow traffic only from LB and GCP firewall rules
      - Allow traffic only from LB and GCP IAP
  
  
  ## Cloud Idnetity-Aware Proxy
  > Controls access to your cloud applications and VMs by verifying user identity and context of the request
  
   - Use IAP to enforce access control policies for reources (app)
   - IAP secure authentication and authorization of all reuqests to App Engine or HTTP(S) Load Balance
